# Define JSON clients with literal strings

The most easy-to-use JSON library ever. 

## Creating clients

Create your JSON clients with just a string to the base URL.

### JSON Placeholder
```swift
let service: AnyService = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
```

### Guild Wars 2
```swift
let gw2: AnyService = "https://api.guildwars2.com/v2"
```

## Fetching results

The callback returns _a throwable block, that returns a tuple_. 
Simply invoke this throwable block, and then you can then inspect 
either the JSON object returned, the `URLRequest`, or handle any errors.

### Fetch Example

```swift
let task = try gw2.fetch(endpoint: "items", "30694") { request in
    do {
        print("\(try request().0)")
    } catch {
        print("\(error)")
    }
    PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}

task.resume()
```

## Project Scope

My motivation was to create the simplest, most lightweight 
JSON Swift client around. I limited the code to 80% of
what many developers need to fetch JSON. 

Swift's powerful typing system could easily allow for a more
featureful, robust framework in the future. For example, I'd
like to explore defining services as a function of their type.
This could lead to something that looks like:
 - `AnyService<RESTful>`
 - `AnyService<Socket>`
 - etc.
